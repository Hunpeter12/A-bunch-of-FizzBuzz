# A bunch of FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz implemented in a bunch of different languages. 

## What is FizzBuzz? 
FizzBuzz is an easy to solve computing problem often used when learning to code. It is like a step up from Hello World. In the problem there are two numbers: Fizz(3), and Buzz(5). The problem is to count to X(100) and print Fizz every time there is a multiple of Fizz(3), print Buzz every time there is a multiple of Buzz(5), and just print the number if the number is a multiple of neither. If number is a multiple of both Fizz(3) and Buzz(5), print FizzBuzz. 

## Wanna add your own? 
Should you wish to add your own implementations you are welcome to. Just submit a pull request ðŸ˜Š Only rules are: 
- Just the code file, no visual studio projects and the like 
-  Try and avoid doing one in the same language (If you do it in a suitably different way then sure) 
-  Fizz and Buzz should be declared at the top 
-  Shouldn't require user interaction (i.e prompt for Fizz, and Buzz)
-  Feel free to leave your a GitHub link or handle in the code file
-  The code must actually produce FizzBuzz 
-  Fizz and Buzz should be set to 3 and 5 when committed to the project.
